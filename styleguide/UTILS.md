# Utils

Maker utils are JS functions which can help you use Maker in your app. A popular example is `makerColors` exported from `@square/maker/utils/maker-colors` which if you simply pass it a background color & a primary color it will generate an entire `colors` theme config object for you.

TODO: add `makerColors` example here eventually
