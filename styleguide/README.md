# Styleguide

The Styleguide showcases all components and provides information on how to use them.

## Development

```sh
$ npm run styleguide
```

### Building & Deploying

```sh
$ npm run styleguide-deploy
```

The built assets are placed into the `/.dist/styleguide/{git-branch-name}` directory and automatically pushed to Github so they should be visible from the [public Square Maker Github Pages directory](https://square.github.io/maker/). You can share the deploy link with anyone if you need them to take a look at your WIP work. You can also view the lab locally by running `npx http-server` from built assets directory and visiting `localhost:8080` in your browser.
